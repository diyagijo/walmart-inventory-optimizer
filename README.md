# 🛒 Retail Demand Forecast & Inventory Optimizer

This is an end-to-end analytics tool that moves from prediction (forecasting sales) to prescription (optimizing inventory). It's built in Python using Prophet and Streamlit.

## 🚀 Live Application

## 💡 The Business Problem

Retail clients constantly struggle to balance the high cost of overstocking with the lost sales from stockouts. This tool provides a data-driven solution by answering two key questions:
1.  **When** should we reorder?
2.  **How much** should we reorder?

## 🛠️ How It Works

1.  **Forecast:** A time-series model (Prophet) forecasts weekly sales, capturing seasonality and the impact of external drivers like temperature and holidays.
2.  **Optimize:** The forecast's uncertainty is used to calculate a full inventory policy (Reorder Point, Safety Stock, EOQ) that is optimized to meet a specific **Service Level**.
3.  **Deploy:** The entire model is deployed as an interactive Streamlit dashboard where a "store manager" can run what-if scenarios to see the exact cost/risk trade-offs of their decisions.
